Likebanana is one-click code-deployment tool developed to ease release process at getanewsletter.com

Likebanana is using fabric, which means that you can use your existing fabric script(if you have one) with likebanana web interface.
If you don't have fabric script, don't worry, default one is provided.

This is how it looks like:

green commit is the current one, red are old ones, and yellow are ready to be deployed.
